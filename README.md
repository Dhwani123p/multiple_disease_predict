The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based web application designed to assist users in predicting the likelihood of three major diseases: diabetes, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, and heart disease. By utilizing user-inputted medical information, the system processes data through pre-trained models to generate accurate and reliable predictions. The web-based interface ensures ease of use for individuals without technical expertise, providing insightful visualizations and results that help users understand their health risks. This project aims to bridge the gap between medical expertise and early disease detection, promoting proactive healthcare measures.
